#Goals:
#   Begin development of an automatic parser. Homework #3 will require the implementation of the CKY algorithm.
#   Develop and manipulate a representation for context-free grammars.
#   Improve your understanding of Chomsky Normal Form and weak grammatical equivalence through implementation.
#
#Requirements:
#   Converting a general context-free grammar to Chomsky Normal Form
#       Read in an original context-free grammar.
#       Convert this grammar to Chomsky Normal Form.
#       Print out the rules of the converted grammar to a file.
#
#   Programming
#       Create a program named hw2_tocnf.{py|pl|java|....etc} to perform the conversion described above invoked as:
#           hw2_tocnf.<ext> <input_grammar_file> <output_grammar_file>
#       where
#           <input_grammar_file> is the name of the file holding the grammar to convert to Chomsky Normal Form. The file will be in NLTK context-free grammar format.
#           <output_grammar_file> is the name of the output file for the CNF conversion. The file should be in the NLTK grammar format, but now in Chomsky Normal Form.
#
#   Verification & Parse Comparison
#       Using your system from HW#1, you will parse a set of sentences with
#           a general NLTK context-free grammar, and
#           a weakly equivalent Chomsky Normal Form context-free grammar, created by your CNF conversion program.
#       Note: You will need to run your code yourself in both these conditions with the files specified below.
#             You will include the output parse files in your submission tar file. You do *not* need to run this code as part of your condor file.
#
#***NOTE:Also, review the parses generated by the original grammar and those from the converted CNF grammar. Provide a brief discussion of similarities and differences.

#               Describe Work:
#
#   Problems Encountered? Yes,
#       1.) they were related to recursively parsing the Unit Production rules with Python. The sample set I used originally worked great with the
#           toy and other samples I used. However when I tried it with the atis.cfg sample the file converted fine to CNF, but wouldn't produce parses using
#           HW1s parser.
#       2.) Output Grammar file to be used as input to parser - format?
#               -I wasn't able to get the parser I created in class's HW1 to produce any parses after converting the CFG grammar file to CNF format
#       Were they solvable? Not in the time frame I had.
#
#       How?
#       Insights?
#       Special Features?
#
#   Leasons Learned:
#           -Most of my issues in respects to time and completing the assignment were due to a learning curve with Python.
#            I continually have to lookup comparable programming concepts between Java and Python.
#
#       Examples:
#
#
#   Were there parts of the project not able to be completed?
#
#       Why? I wasn't able to get the atis converted cfg file to parse the test sentences provided using HW1's parser
#
#       What was tried and/or what didn't work? I tried updating the Parser with different parser types as well as reformatting the CNF conversion logic
#           with more time i'd be able to have get the Unit Production rule working with the atis sample set.
#
#   Discussion: Parses generated by the original grammar and those from the converted CNF grammar, smiliarities and differences
#       No similarities, the CNF file produced had no sentences parsed as a result of running this grammar file through HW1s parser.
