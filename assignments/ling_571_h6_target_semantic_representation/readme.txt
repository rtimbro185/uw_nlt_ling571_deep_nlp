Goals:
    Explore the logic and lambda calculus based representations of natural language semantics.
    Analyze the interaction between semantic attachments and syntactic structure for semantic analysis.
    Gain some further familiarity with NLTK.
    Augment grammars with semantic attachments to produce sentential analyses.

    Key Concepts not clearly understood:
        In the end I was unable to implement the negation conditions in the given format I was trying to work.
        Oddly when I first reviewed the assignment these seemed to be the simplest, however example implementations would
        have been valuable. In all the hours I spent reviewing on-line material regarding predicate logic and
        first-order-calculus, along with purchased books such as "Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus"
        I thought I had a good grasp of how to implement it this concept.

    Challenges:
    This exercise proved harder then it first appeared. I found I was able to follow the class lecture material
    to a point, but when it came to implementing the first-order-predicate logic into the grammar file I was challenged
    by how the conjunctions and negations were to be applied and stumbled around with the NLTK specific
    syntax. The challenge I found the hardest was narrowing in on how to actually implement the grammar rule specifications.
    In my research I came across many different semantic analysis representation models which in the end I believe
    confused me more regarding this assignment then helping me.

    Research Material Used:
        -"Semantics & Pragmatics - Sentence Semantics, www.linguistics-online.com": I reviewed the core 14 lectures in
        this series in efforts to better understand the scope of applying semantic analysis to word syntax and see how words
        combine into successively larger structures to form phrases and sentences.
